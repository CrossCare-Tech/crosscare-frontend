Question that was asked: "${questionContext}"

Person's response: "${userResponse}"

Type of concern identified: ${trigger.replace('_', ' ')}

Please generate a warm, empathetic response that:
1. Acknowledges their feelings and validates their experience
2. Shows genuine care and concern
3. Is supportive without being judgmental
4. Is brief (2-3 sentences maximum)
5. Feels natural and conversational, not scripted
6. Does not ask follow-up questions (we'll handle that separately)
7. Does not offer solutions yet, just emotional support

Your response should sound like a caring healthcare professional, not a therapist or counselor.
Provide only the response text, no additional commentary.`;
